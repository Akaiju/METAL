# METAL
An isometric shooter about a glitch-awoken robot fighting their way out of the facility they're created in. 
Players take control of the robot and are besieged by other machines and must fight their way up from the basement of the factory they're in to reach the surface for some chance of escape.
Set in a grimy, apocalyptic-future world, it's all about testing player reaction times and working in enclosed environments with whatever tools are at their disposal.
